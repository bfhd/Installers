Text Installers

This repository will help me track changes in the Text installer batch files.

Requirements for each site:
- A new connectionstring.xml will be needed.
- Change the service code in MediScribe.Applications.Main.exe.config.
- Change the WinscribeURL in Text.reg for each site
- Update HTI.Ribbonbridge.dll version if a new text client version is released
